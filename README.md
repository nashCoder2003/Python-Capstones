Welcome to my collection of Python capstone projects, built between May 2024 – Present, focused on practical problem-solving, automation, API integration, and GUI development.

Each project explores real-world applications—from terminal-based simulations and productivity tools to interactive GUI apps and API-powered utilities. 
The goal of this capstone series is to apply core Python concepts such as:

✅ Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
✅ RESTful API consumption
✅ GUI creation with Tkinter
✅ Data persistence (JSON, CSV, Google Sheets)
✅ Automation and scripting
Whether it's building a habit tracker, a secure password manager, or a stock news alert system, these projects demonstrate hands-on experience with key development tools and 
libraries including requests, random, tkinter, json, and more.
